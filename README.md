Exam demonstrating multi-threading capabilities...


There are two branches here. Master is trying to create a solution as was asked to. The second branch contains provably-fair solution as an alternative to the required solution. 

The provably-fair solution is trying to solve problem, where player might suspect the e-casino cheating and picking the result depending on how he bets and making him lose more than how much he would use with normal distribution of results. 

Note that I am not an owner of the whole code. I am owner of the solution module. Please read the readme.pdf for details.
